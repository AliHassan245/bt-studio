## Introduction

Behavior Trees is an **open-source** tool crafted for the development of robotic applications. Its primary objective is to facilitate the quick deployment of behaviour tree-based robotic behaviours within ROS. By utilizing tree structures defined in XML, coupled with actions scripted in Python, the tool efficiently generates a ROS-executable tree. This process circumvents the unnecessary complexities often associated with ROS-specific configurations, offering developers a more streamlined approach.

## Roadmap

In the future, this project will have total integration with [RoboticsAcademy](https://github.com/JdeRobot/RoboticsAcademy), so developers will be able to develop trees in a graphical interface, and deploy them in a dockerized environment. 

* Local execution
* Web-based tree designer with local 
* Integration with dockerized environment, with the capacity to execute the applications both in simulated and real robots.
