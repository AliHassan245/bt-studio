## Introduction

Behavior Trees is an **open-source** tool crafted for the development of robotic applications. Its primary objective is to facilitate the quick deployment of behavior tree-based robotic applications within ROS. In BehaviorTrees, a robotic app is defined as an XML tree coupled with actions scripted in Python, which the tool then translates into a ROS 2 package. This process circumvents the unnecessary complexities often associated with ROS-specific configurations, offering developers a more streamlined approach.
## Usage

## Roadmap

In the future, this project will have total integration with [RoboticsAcademy](https://github.com/JdeRobot/RoboticsAcademy), so developers will be able to develop trees in a graphical interface and deploy them in a dockerized environment. The expected roadmap is as follows: 

* Local execution
* Web-based tree designer with local execution
* Integration with a dockerized environment
